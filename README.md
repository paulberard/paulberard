# ğŸ‘‹ Hello, world!

ğŸ“š Hi all, Iâ€™m @paulberard. I'm currently pursuing a Master of Engineering (AI, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Physics) at CentraleSupÃ©lec (Paris-Saclay University), one of Franceâ€™s leading Engineering Schools.

ğŸ“ˆ I'm passionate about AI, Machine Learning technologies and Data Science. I'm currently developing my skillset in those subjects through internships and additional courses to keep creating cool projects and hopefully make a positive impact along the way.
